"""agent_runtime: agent_turns.started_at — no-op reconciliation.

The original intent of this migration was to add `started_at` to
`agent_turns`, but 0002_agent_runtime already ships the column (the
"Turn" semantic split from `created_at` was put in place from day 1
during the agent_runtime P1 cutover). Re-running the ADD COLUMN here
fails with ``DuplicateColumnError`` on a fresh database.

This revision is kept in the chain so environments that previously
applied it remain at the same head, but the upgrade is now a no-op:
``started_at`` is guaranteed by 0002. Downgrade is also a no-op for the
same reason.
